{-
Things that attach to chords
  Articulation marks, lyrics, technique, expression, instrument change text (like pizz.)

Everything that is not taking up time is positioned in a separate sub-layer?
  I.e. dynamic marks start/stops, caesuras, slur lines.
  Mind that most backends will treat these as start/stop/continue marks (i.e. no separate layer!)

type Chord                   = [Pitch] -- TODO articularion marks etc, see above
