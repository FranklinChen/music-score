-- Provides a musical score represenation.
--
-- An value can have a negative onset, representing a values occuring before the
-- reference time. Durations must be positive, allthough the types does not
-- enforce this.
--
-- An value is either a /note/ or a /rest/ (represented by the 'Just' and 'Nothing'
-- constructors). Having explicit rests allow us to concatenate scores based on
-- duration even if the score is actually empty.
--
-- Scores allow overlapping values, but can be split into parts, which does not.
