HasPosition vs HasDuration

Rest/Note/Chord
Voice
    Duration but no position
    Delay has no effect
    Can not have reset/pickup (as this is a concept that has to do with position)
Delayed a
    Has duration if a has duration
    Defines onset?
Chord = [Delayed a]
    Two ways of looking at it:
        1) The time values in delayed "moves" the contained value
        2) The local origin of the contained value is moved

Think of it as vector/point addition
Notes and Voices are like vectors: they have no "location"
    However they might have a notion of a "local origin", typically shorter than itself.

    <-        duration        ->
    <- pickUp -> | <- putDown ->

    They might also have two origins, one on, one off, a la TPTM.
    
    <- pickup -> ON <- sound -> OFF <- putDown ->
    
    More generally, they may have an function from "nominal" duration (0 = on, 1 = off)
    to local duration (i.e. difference between nominal on sounding position).
    This generalizes what Hudak calls ? in TPTM.
    
You can add them up any way.
