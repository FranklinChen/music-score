type PlacedVoice a = (Scalar Duration, Voice a)
-- (0,...) for onset alignment (1...) for offset alignment etc
-- Alignment outside [0..1] also possible
-- Therefore we have (PlacedVoice a `Iso Delayed (Voice a))
-- We also have (PlacedVoice a `Iso` Reactive (Maybe a))
-- We have (Prism (Score a) (PlacedVoice a)), matching a score of contingous, non-overlapping notes starting at an arbitrary point

type Score a = [Note a]
-- Free Monoid
instance Transformable (Score a) where
  transform s = fmap (transform s)
-- TODO what is the Position instance?
-- We need a Monoid to fold the spans of each note into a single span
-- Can not use the transform monoid, instead we need a hull
-- Breaks TCMs! Another problem is that there is no hull for Spans (as *ordered* pairs)


-- Both PlacedVoice and Score support various notions of position

-- For the simplest case we simply disregard negative durations (and so non-forward spans)
-- as well as nominal/actual position (so no anacrusis) â€“ both cases trivial.

-- To deal with anacrusis etc., both PlacedVoice and Score must include an extra Span, 
-- defining logical position (as opposed to actual position of its components). Either
-- define this as a separate value (defaulting to same as actual position) and transform,
-- or define as a transformation from actual to logical time (or vice versa) and default
-- to mempty. This would give us the same power as TPTM.
